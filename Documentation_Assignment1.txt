Since the project is a team project and our group is a small group (two members) we need to work very close to others. We set up a long in-person meeting for talking about the idea to implement the project for the class and the assignments. Besides that, we talked over the phone regularly to feel connected to the project. Since we are from different backgrounds than other students in the class (no strong background in object-oriented programming), we are going through a very steep learning curve. For this reason, we set a learning path for this class. In each meeting, we go through some materials that are required to successfully finish the assignments.
For this assignment, we both worked on writing working codes and since one of the code is working as per assignment direction (Abhinav Singh), we are planning to keep the codes in the GitHub. Therefore, Abhinav is serving as the leader of the implementation part. On the other hand, Anamul Haque is giving feedback on the different approach of solving the problem and assuring the code is working. Overall, Abhinav figured out the design and implementation and put Anamul in the Quality assurance of the submitted codes.
